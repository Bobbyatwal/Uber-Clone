# Uber-Clone
Uber Clone for iOS and Android devices developed with React Native and powered by React Native [React Navigation, React Hooks, React Native Elements] Redux, Google Maps APIs [Google Places API, Google Matrix API, Google Directions API], TailwindCSS, and Expo Go.

Google Places API: Allowed for Google Autocomplete engine which that provides suggestions to users as they enter their search query into the search box
Google Matrix API: Returns JSON Data providing origin + destination details and mileage information
Google Directions API: Google Web service that uses an HTTP request to return JSON directions between locations in the map.

Redux: Maintains state consistently across the project components. Redux was used to dispatch and select information to/from the store such as user Origin, desired Destination, and Travel Time Information (total distance in miles, duration in minutes, and unique number values to calculate pricing options).

Expo: Used for development as an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
